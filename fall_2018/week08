Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week was the Thanksgiving break and we finally find a way to solve problems with the pictures. Since Sumsung Gear 360 only supports
several kinds of Sumsung phone which we don't have, we finally decided to use Apple phone to take pictures and with editting it to access
the same result.

This Week's Plan
This week hope we will sucessfully change all pictures into right mode and start wroking on the backend and build the data base. And I will
keep learning about PHP and HTML.

Anything Blocking?
Still need to be more familiar with PHP and need to start connectting the back end to the front end.

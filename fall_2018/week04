Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, we were planning to collect data from the collegiate store. However, since it was family weekend, there was actually a lot of people
in the store last week and also since the camera out of battery, we didn't finish collect all the data. Therefore, we will keep collect data
this week. Also, I am still learning PHP and getting more and more familar with it.


This Week's Plan
This week hope we will finish collect all the data and start wroking on the backend and build the data base. 

Anything Blocking?
Still need to be more familiar with PHP.

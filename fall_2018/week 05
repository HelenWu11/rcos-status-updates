Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, we were planning to collect data from the collegiate store. We did take pictures of the store, however, since we 
all don't have the phone with Android, we couldn't save pictures as the google street mode. So we were still working on this.
Also, I am still learning PHP and getting more and more familar with it.


This Week's Plan
This week hope we will finish collect all the data and change all pictures into right mode and start wroking on the backend and build the data base. 

Anything Blocking?
Still need to be more familiar with PHP.

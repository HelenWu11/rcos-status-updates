Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I didn't progress much since me and my friends went to the HackCooper 2018. However, we did borrow a camera from Pro Turner and I
learned some more about PHP.


This Week's Plan
This week we will go to the collegiate store and use the camera to collect some data and will keep learning PHP.

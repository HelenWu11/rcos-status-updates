For my last week, me and my back-end group working on contacting Professor Turner about getting server of our school and we
got some really helpful informations from him. I also learned about PHP last week and tried to get more and more familiar with it 
and how PHP can work with HTML. This week I will still keep learning and try to have some progress on the back-end of our project.

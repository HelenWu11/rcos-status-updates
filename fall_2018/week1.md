## Last Week's Accomplishments
For my last week, me and my back-end group working on contacting Professor Turner about getting server of our school and we
got some really helpful informations from him. I also learned about PHP last week and tried to get more and more familiar with it 
and how PHP can work with HTML. 

 ## Next Week's Plan
 This week I will still keep learning and try to have some progress on the back-end of our project.
 
 ### Examples
- learn PHP

 ## Blockers
 Sometimes it's hard to understand some concepts or usages of PHP by myself.

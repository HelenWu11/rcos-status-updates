For this semester, I didn't commit a lot of codes to our project since I am doing mostly studying and writing codes and help making change
locally. For my learning part, I mainly learned PHP and JavaScript from this website:http://www.runoob.com/ which I found out really useful.
And besides learning by myself, I went to attend two hackathons these semesters and found out although they were challenging, but were fun 
and were good ways to practice myself. I will definitely attend more when I am more confidence for my coding. Throughout this project, I mainly
learned from my teammates as well as providing ideas and helping find out some bugs, therefore, I didn't commit lots of useful codes or make
some progress changes. However, I already get some general ideas about rcos and I think it's fun and chanllenging which I will definitely 
take next semester and try to have more my own progress and coding.

Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, since I got a lot of exam, so I didn't progress much and I didn't have time to meet with my teammate to figure out how to 
change the store pics into the right form. However, I learned some new things about PHP last week.


This Week's Plan
This week hope we will sucessfully change all pictures into right mode and start wroking on the backend and build the data base. 

Anything Blocking?
Still need to be more familiar with PHP and need to start connectting the back end to the front end.

Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, since I got two exams and two quizzes, however, I still keep learning about PHP and HTML. Since this is my first time to have 
Rocs and I realized how different it is from other classes. I need to learn new things by myself and with my friends. It is definitly 
a great challenge but also fun to learn new things in this way. 


This Week's Plan
This week hope we will sucessfully change all pictures into right mode and start wroking on the backend and build the data base. And I will
keep learning about PHP and HTML.

Anything Blocking?
Still need to be more familiar with PHP and need to start connectting the back end to the front end.

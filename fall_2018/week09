Last Week's Accomplishments
Because I got two exams this week so I didn't do lot last week. However, I started collecting codes that I wrote to test or learn throughout
this semester and I did learn a lot from this semester. 

This Week's Plan
This week hope we will sucessfully change all pictures into right mode and start wroking on the backend and build the data base. And I will
keep learning about PHP and HTML.

Anything Blocking?
Still need to be more familiar with PHP and need to start connectting the back end to the front end.

Last Week's Accomplishment
Last week, I was more busy than I expected and I was super sick during the weekend, therefore, I didn't make a lot of progress on the program.
However, I did learn a little bit about how to use git and I am still on my way learning how to use php.


This Week's Plan
For this week, I will keep studying php nad html and work with my group memberes to make some progress on the project.
